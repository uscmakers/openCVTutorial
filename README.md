# openCVTutorial
## Installation
We will be using a jupyter notebook to run the following tutorial which means dependencies can be managed easier. I currently am using Python version 3.12.7 which I recommend. To download this go to [THIS LINK](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3127/) and download the corresponding version to your computer. If you already have a python version, make sure you can download the ipynb package using pip. The following command should work
```bash
pip install ipynb
```

## Set up
To get started, I will be using VScode which I heavily recommend using to get started. Open up the notebook, and choose the kernel in the top right.

Select the kernel to be a Python environment and choose create python environment.

Once selected click Venv. This creates a python virtual environment so it does not mess with your computer's version of python. No need to worry about what it is if this is confusing. We are just not interfering. Click Python 3.12.7 again. and this should create a .venv folder in your directory.
